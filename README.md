# Hash Method
It has Been Used Createhash Method of Crypto Module and "sha256" Algorithm in Our App  <br>
The main reason technology leaders use SHA-256 is that it doesn't have any known vulnerabilities that make it insecure and it has not been “broken” unlike some other popular hashing algorithms.
As a whole, SHA-256 is better than MD5 because the output size is twice longer and the probability of collisions is lower. 
SHA256 is recommended by NIST as having adequate hashing strength for passwords, at least for now.
